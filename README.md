- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lv4n4
- 🦸🏻‍♀️ I'm a It/Tech Recruiter 
- 🤓 I'm trying to learn GitHub
- ❤️‍🔥 I'm passionate about technology, AI, science fiction, dystopias and many other things
- 💞 I'm not here to write code, as I'm not skilled in it, but I'd like to start creating a repository dedicated to job opportunities and to collecting feedback, suggestions, impressions and experiences about the world of work and the selection processes from developers (work in progress).
- 🔗 https://bit.ly/3W1YPlS 👈 for now, this is what I update often, you will find active job listings here.
